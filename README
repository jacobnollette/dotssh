# dot ssh

## Basics
Initialize this in your ~/.ssh. This will not overwrite your keys, but instead it will symbolic link your authorized_keys and config files.

ssh-keygen -t rsa; #click through the prompt, to generate key
cd ~/.ssh;
git init;
git remote add origin git@github.com:jnollette/dotfiles;
git pull origin master;
cd bin;
./create;
./build;

Fork this repo into a private repo, and house your cascading keys in git.

bin-global is the globals... Touch and create multiple files w/o file extension, for compartmentalized keys
bin-print is the print folder. It gets overwritten every time your build.
bin-machine is the granular approach. You can add keys or configs to specifc machines.
